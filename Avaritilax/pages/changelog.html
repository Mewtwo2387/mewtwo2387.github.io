<h2 class="h2s changelog-others block">Roadmap</h2>
<p class="ps block multiline">As I've mentioned before in ICGD, this game progresses quadratically instead of linearly compared to other idle games. Instead of having a currency that can buy stuff that generates that currency, we have stuff that generates KG, and KG generates money via clicks, then stuff costs money. Spending does not decrease KG. Essentially stuff generates money per second per second given you're clicking at the same speed. This makes idle play incredibly overpowered.
This game was modelled after Cookie Clicker, with those CC-styled achievements and upgrades, which, well, stuff doesn't go up this quickly. And I'm playing Antimatter Dimensions rn and that goes up really quickly with layers of stuff generating stuff just like Swarmsim. So either I keep the current CC-style or straight up change to an AD-styled game, bringing in layers of generation and prestige, hit infinity, go break-infinity.js, turn Snorlax into a black hole. (I mean, isn't that the point)
The thing is, stuff like mining and exploration is gonna have a hard time striving in this environment. They are meant to give some small boosts to progression, which wouldn't work when stuff is doubling every other second.
Either way we're gonna follow what we left off a year ago and a1.1.x is gonna finish the mining stuff, a1.2.x will overhaul this horrendous UI with this horrendous changelog written in pure HTML.</p>

<h1 class="block">Alpha 1.1.2</h1>

<p class="ps block multiline changelog-quote">"AUG: Oh, hello there. Here I am back to this shit. The only difference is that I'm now doing it during work instead of during physics lessons. And the good thing is, I have done so little of 1.1.2 previously in January that there's no semi-finished stuff to pick up."
"AUG: Like, the only thing I've done in January is writing a bunch of stuff in the changelog. No coding."
"AUG: Another cool thing, I'm using github now."
"AUG: Probably the biggest update. Bigger than 1.1.0. That's clearly why it took 8 months right?"
"NOV: hello again. I'm here again. This time in London. Finally finishing up 1.1.2. Well not really cause it's just some buttons with nothing but functionality. At least you can now progress."</p>
<h2 class="h2s changelog-additions block">Additions</h2>
<p class="ps block multiline"><b>Alchemy</b></p>
<p class="ps block multiline changelog-quote">"And there goes our eventuallies from 1.1.0"</p>
<p class="ps block multiline">- Introduced Alchemy
    - Fishsticks can now be obtained by buying fishballs
        - It isn't retroactive. Like, this entire Alchemy thing doesn't work on old saves anyway. Missing variables aren't added to old saves. This is alpha after all.
    - Items can be crafted using catalyst and resources from mining
        - 7 x pickaxe recipes (C000-006)
            - Fishstick pickaxe is crafted from 5 fishsticks and 10 catalyst providing a first pickaxe to mine stone, darkstone and coal.
            - Stone and darkstone pickaxe is crafted from 2 fishsticks, 3 stone/darkstone, 20 catalyst, and 1 darkstuff for darkstone pickaxe, which can mine haematite.
                - Darkstone should be more duarble than stone, but durability isn't a thing for now.
            - Iron (smelted from haematite) pickaxe mines silver and gold.
            - Lumium (alloy of silver and gold) pickaxe mines diamond and golden fishball.
            - Diamond pickaxe mines soulstone and crystal
            - Soulstone pickaxe mines soulgem. 
            - They cost 50/100/200/333 catalyst, 4//8/16/32 fishstick, and 3/3/3/2 of the respective resources.
        - 3 x furnace recipes (C020-022)
            - Simple furnace cost 50 catalyst and 8 stone
            - Advanced furnace cost 200 catalyst and 4 refined stone, 4 refined darkstone. It gives a 20% chance of double output.
                - Double output is not a thing for now.
            - Dark furnace cost 200 catalyst and 8 refined darkstone, 8 darkstuff. It gives a 40% chance to burn the item and 60% chance to double output
                - That is also not a thing for now.
            - Furnace smelts raw ores into material
        - 1 x refinary recipe (C030)
            - Simple refinary cost 200 catalyst, 8 stone, and 4 iron
            - Refinary refine material into it's refined form
        - 1 x alloy furnace recipe (C040)
            - Simple alloy furnace cost 200 catalyst, 8 stone, and 4 iron
            - Alloy furnace mixes material into other material
        - 7 x statue recipes (C050-056)
            - Stone, darkstone, iron, silver, gold, diamond, crystal statues, each cost 10 of the refined material (except crystal which cannot be refined) and 10 darkstuff for darkstone, and 100/100/200/400/600/800/1000 catalyst.
            - It does nothing right now
        - 3 x gold recipes (C060-062)
            - Each triples the KGPS of a specific building
            - Costs 1 Golden Fishball or Fat Blob, 1 Soulgem, 1000 catalyst, and a bunch of other stuff.
            - It doesn't work now  
    - Furnace can smelt certain stuff using some time and some coal
        - Haematite is the only smeltable item for now, costing 1 coal and 8 seconds, giving iron.
        - However in this version there's no time required nor a UI, nor a furnace required.
        - I have no idea what else it should be able to smelt for now
    - Refinary can refine certain stuff using some time and some coal
        - Refining stone and darkstone cost 1 coal and 8 seconds
        - Refining iron, silver, and gold cost 2 coal and 16 seconds, nor a refinary required.
        - Refining diamond cost 4 coal and 32 seconds
        - However in this version there's no time required nor a UI.
    - Alloy furnace can mix certain stuff using some time and some catalyst
        - Lumium is the only mixable item for now, costing 10 catalyst, 10 seconds, 1 gold, 1 silver
        - However in this version there's no time required nor a UI, nor a alloy furnace required.
        - Maybe iron+coal for steel later</p>

<p class="block">05/09/2022 - 16/09/2022</p>
<p class="ps block multiline changelog-quote multiline">"1.1 was planned to be the mining update 7 months ago. And then alchemy goes with it, otherwise mined stuff are useless. And then missions also goes with it to unlock mining. And then a lot of stuff is introduced. And then a lot of stuff is no longer introduced because I can't add that much in one update. So now we only have basic mining and missions in 1.1.0."
"Gonna finish the rest in 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc. Why not just put them in one update, when it doesn't matter at all because the game isn't even released? Because big version number cool."

<h2 class="h2s changelog-additions block">Additions</h2>
<p class="ps block multiline"><b>Missions</b>
- Introduced missions
    - There are currently only 1 set of missions.
        - Each set, supposingly, should all contain 10 missions</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"KEYWORD: SUPPOSINGLY"</p>
    <p class="ps block multiline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Set 1 missions include:
            - Reach a total of 50000 KG
            - Reach 50 KGPS from fishballs
            - Reach 125 KGPS from burgers
            - Reach 250 KGPS from restaurants
            - Obtain 2 Factories
            - Click 2222 times
            - Hit a Critical Click 50 times
            - Buy 12 Upgrades
            - Get 24 achievements
            - Attempt to enter the mines
    - All mission gives some catalyst when completed, and some also gives a multiplier or other items as a reward
        - Multipliers from missions stack addictively with each other, but multiplicatively with other Multipliers
            - For example, getting two +5% KGPS multipliers from missions and buying a +5% KGPS upgrade will grant a +15.5% bonus (1.1x1.05)
        - This is the first thing to grant catalyst, although the label is in the game since it exist
    - Completing a mission set gives more rewards and unlocks something
        - Set 1: 250 catalyst, 1 golden fishball, unlocks alchemy and mining
        - Set 2: (probably) 500 catalyst, 2 golden fishball, unlocks isekai portal 
        - Set 3: (probably) 750 catalyst, 3 golden fishball, unlocks ascension
<p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ascension wasn't something that was considered before. But after 7 months all of a sudden I want to have some ascension upgrades before you can move on to shop 2 or 3. Mostly bacuse now that wiping save is easier"</p>

<p class="ps block multiline"><b>Mining</b>
- Introduced mining
    - The mining area is 40(depth)x20(width)
        - Stone generates above layer 20, and deepstone 20 or below.

            - A diamond pick is required to mine them. eventually.
            - Refining a soulgem allows the mining map to be ascended. But we dont talk about that yet. Not even "eventually"
    - Stuff generates, you can mine them, but pickaxes and such comes "eventually" as you can see above. The mined stuff are currently useless without alchemy. <i>It comes eventually.</i>
    - 1 Stamina is required to mine 1 block. This value can be upgraded eventually.
        - 2 achievements give 1 stamina. This value can be upgraded eventually.

    - Which means that no need to separately save localStorage items anymore. I can now add as many vars as i want without updating save.js
    - Which also means that I have to add "GD." to all variables in the code. Which also means that I probably missed some. So more bugs.
    - Food is now stored in the same array. No more separate variables named after the food. Easier to update all food. And easier to miss some of the old code that still contained those variables. More bugs.

- Added 1 more KGPS upgrade and 1 cost upgrade for each food item (18 upgrades total), to a total of 6 KGPS and 2 cost upgrade per food
    - Unlocked from the 150 achi (6th achi for most food, 8th for portal)
    - The KGPS upgrade cost x1t base price while the cost upgrade cost x500b.
    - The cost upgrade reduces cost by 30%.
    - As the 150th food already cost 750b times base price, these prices are actually quite low.
<b>Animations</b>
- Added a small boing when hovering any button, and a slighly larger boing when clicking it. (Including the snorlax button)
    - There is also a small boing when clicking clickable divs.
- Snorlax now "breaths" slightly every 2 seconds.</p>
<p class="ps changelog-quote block">"BOING BOINGS. Now how do we only make that part boing?"</p>
<h2 class="h2s changelog-changes block">Changes</h2>
<p class="ps block multiline"><b>Achievements</b>
- With the total money tracked for stats, money achis now count total money instead of wallet money.
<b>Loading</b>
- Apparently javascript calls functions parallelly, so when initializing it might tick and update before achis are completely init'd if it took too long. To solve the issue, they are now called one after another in a chain.
    - Achis and ups actually take a few seconds to load, however the game starts before they are fully loaded, resulting in a few second of freezing in the previous versions. So now there is now a loading screen, the game will start only when everything is loaded.
<b>Display</b>
- Navigation tabs are now very slightly translucent instead of completely transparent. Hovering at it makes it less transparent. Same for the 2 login buttons.
<b>Planned Content</b>
- Bururururger in evolution shop is replaced with Rare Burgergummies, like rare candy in SC2
    - There aren't much to talk about in ups and achis as bururururgers are too similar to burgers.
    - Bururururger is now a basic shop burger upgrade instead</p>
<h2 class="h2s changelog-fixes block">Fixes</h2>
<p class="ps block multiline">001 The game starts off with a few seconds of freezing, unable to interact with anything and the fonts are wrong in those few seconds
008 Notif cross button is shown on start
009 Some of the 4th/5th KGPS upgrades cost x50k/50m base price instead of x100k/100m
010 Achi might reset due to ticking and updating before achi loading, as javascript runs function parallelly.</p>

    - The 4th upgrade cost x100k and the fifth cost x100m base price, which is x100 and x1000 the previous upgrade respectively.
</p>
<h2 class="h2s changelog-changes block">Changes</h2>
<p class="ps block multiline"><b>Upgrades</b>
- Completely replaced the manual click upgrades.
    - Instead of giving an x% chance of registering 2 clicks, it is replaced with a "critical click" feature
        - Crit Rate represent the chance of performing a crit click per click, and Crit Dmg represents the Dmg increase for a crit click

"Finally it's a working game, so time for alpha. From now on the changelog will be shown as Additons/Subtractions/Changes/Fixes, as if anyone cares. Also, every version would be saved as a zip, as if anyone will want an older version. Basically wasting my computer space."</p>
    <h2 class="h2s changelog-additions block">Additions</h2>
    <p class="ps block multiline"><b>Notifications</b>   
- Added a notif section at the bottom, showing a notif when unlocking an achi and when saving the game. The 3 most recent achi notifs will be shown, others will be hidden as "+x more notifs". Notifs can be cleared.
<b>Achievements</b>
- Added 12 new achievements (2 KG 5 Money 5 Level) to make it more consistent. KG, KGPS, Level, and Money now all have 25 achis each.
- Added the achi A000, unlocked immediately when starting the game
- There are now a total of 202 working achis in the game.
<b>Upgrades</b>
- Introduced upgrades to the game, so now you can actually play for a while. That's why it's alpha now
- Because some achis doesn't unlock upgrades, some unlock 2, and some upgrades aren't going to be unlocked from achis, upgrades ID are independent from achi ids.
    - Added "unlock1" and "unlock2" to the Achi list indicating the ID of the upgrade unlocked from the achi
    - Upgrade list is also 2000 items, although there are much less ups and achis currently
- Currently there are 92 upgrades:
    - 26 x KGPS% "fat blob" upgrades (U000-U025)
        - Each upgrades increases the total KGPS multi by a percentage, stacked additively.
        - Unlocked from KG achi A000-A025
        - First upgrade cost $100, suceeding upgrade cost x12 more. Final upgrade cost around 95.4 Octillion.
    - 25 x MPC% "finger" upgrades (U051-U075)
        - Each upgrades increases the total MPC multi by a percentage, stacked additively.
        - Unlocked from Money achi A151-175.
        - First upgrade cost $1200, suceeding upgrade cost x12 more. Final upgrade cost around 95.4 Octillion.
    - 5 x Manuel Click upgrades (U101-105)
        - Each upgrade gives a 10% chance to register 2 clicks in one click, stacked additively.
        - Unlocked from Manuel Click achi A201-A205.
        - First upgrade cost $10000, suceeding upgrade cost x10 more. Final upgrade cost 100 Million.
    - 36 x Food upgrades (U151-U154,U176-U179,U201-U204,U226-U229,U251-U254,U276-U279,U301-U304,U326-U329,U351-U354)
        - Each food have 3 upgrades that doubles KGPS and 1 upgrade that reduces cost by 20%, both stacked multiplicatively.
        - The first 3 food achis unlock 3 KGPS upgrades, and the third one also unlocks the cost upgrade
        - The KGPS upgrade cost x10/x100/x1000 of the base price of the food, and the cost upgrade cost x500.
        - As always, portal is a special case. The first 2 portal KGPS upgrade triples KGPS, and cost x20/x200.
        - Most of the KGPS upgrades are copied from SC3
- None of the upgrades have an icon yet.</p>
<p class="ps changelog-quote block multiline">"Being stupid x 1 : You finished writing the code and decided to start testing. But nothing worked at all. Nothing showed up. After repetitive testing, you realized that after writing the function, you didn't include it in the init code."
"Being stupid x 2: It showed up, but why does it still not work? After some checking, you then realized that you didn't capitilize some vars properly"
"Being stupid x 3: Why doesn't the upgrades hide when locked? After some checking, you realized that you somehow messed up the placement of the display:none, instead of hiding the div you hid the img"
"Being stupid x 4: Why does it still show an error message? After more checking, you realized that you typed display instead of style.display"
"Being stupid x n: Why does it still not work properly? After even more checking, you realized that the 'Unlock' in the excel is capitalized and so is the json, but you didn't capitalize in the code"
"And more..."

    <h2 class="h2s changelog-changes block">Changes</h2>
    <p class="ps block multiline"><b>Display</b>
- To fit for other resolutions and to fix bug 002 and 003, displays are now in position:absolute and is no longer at a fixed size
    - Displays now stretches to the bottom of the screen no matter the resolution or zoom
    - Displays won't go off screen now
    - The top display now stretches all the way to the right, and the width of the content will stretch too.</p>
<p class="ps changelog-quote block">"POV: You asked a stupid question on Stack Overflow again"</p>
<p class="ps block multiline"><b>Achievements</b>
- Increased the achievement list from 1000 to 2000 items
    - Including the evolution shop and ascension shop items, food item achis will span from A251-A950. So more space is needed for other achis
    - Reserved A951-A1000 for total items/updrages bought, and 1976-1999 for meta achievements (achis about achis)
    - The ID of misc achis now starts at A1901 instead of A901
- Achievements now shows in notifs in the bottom of the screen instead of the (temporary) windows alert</p>
<b>Minor Changes</b>
- Shopitem label does not have a definite height now, so there can be long upgrade names just like in SC3
    <h2 class="h2s changelog-fixes block">Fixes</h2>
    <p class="ps block multiline">- 002 Other tabs are not hidden when loading the game

    <h2 class="h2s changelog-others block">Progress</h2>
    <p class="ps block multiline">- Used a string instead of a 1000 element char array to save upgrades and achis, and instead of saving in localstorage as 2000 separate elememts like "a1:0 a2:1 a3:0.... u999:2" it is simply saved as 2 long strings like "Achievements:"01000....001" Upgrades:"100000...012". Cause it is stupid af to save 2000 seperate variables.
    - Reseted the localStorage to get rid of those 2000 items, so other stuff that are originally in the localstorage, such as google_experiemental_mod, are deleted as well
- The game will now only be saveable and will only tick when logged in.
- Added some console logs for debug
    - There will be a message in the console every tick, update, save, and load when debug is set to true
    - Also shows the time in ms taken for each tick and update, and the time between ticks. Currently at around 4-8ms and sometimes peak at 20ms, so there's probably not much problem with updating everything everytime.. yet
- Added 189 (functional) achievements in the game
    - Instead of hardcoding every single upgrade/achi in like SC3 (And end up with thousands of lines leading to my quit), I converted the excel storing achi info into a json, and have it read from the file
        - Included jquery.js just to read json, first external js in the game!
    - So now, all I have to do is to fill in the excel with the names, desc, type, number of items required, and the achi would work without writing any extra code</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block multiline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gotta say, this is the best and most efficient thing I've made so far"
    "But it took so long for me learn how to properly read a json file" (Asking stupid questions on Stack Overflow)

    "Paimon is out of brain juice!"</p>
    <p class="ps block multiline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Currently there will be a windows alert everytime you get an achi, but that's just a temporary thing, would add modals later

Unlocks after buying a portal.
- Mining: Mine for different raw ores and materials for Alchemy and Research. It will be a 20x20 grid, you get one mining point every 5 achievements, and you can choose to mine in one direction by using one point. Differenct pickaxe tiers gives a different range of blocks you can mine.
- Exploring: Explore for different raw materials and resources for Alchemy and Research. There will be a loot table like dh games.
- Alchemy: Craft raw ore and materials into useful items that boost different aspects of the game. Some equipments will be craftable.
- Research: Uses different resources obtained from Mining, Exploring, and Alchemy for research, which boosts different aspects of the game. There will be 4 inter-foodtype researches (for example, the "Cheesy" research boosts burger and castle KGPS like cookie clicker synergies.)
- Missions: Mission sets similar to the genshin adventurer book. Completing mission sets unlock stuff such as higher tier shops. For example, a mission set could be
Get 150 KGPS from fishballs (0/150.0)
Obtain 25 restaurants (0/25)
Buy one portal (0/1)
Unlock 50 achievements (0/50)
Mine 15 items (0/15)
Wish 50 times (0/50)
Craft 15 items (0/15)
- Achievements: Some achievements boosts corresponding parts of the game, for example "Click 500 times" achievement can boost MPCperKG by 10%. Achievements also gives catalysts and mining points.</p>

    <p class="ps block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Finally drew the 2 remaining food assets I missed in SC3, just to include them in the banner</p>
    <p class="ps block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Implemented save&load with local storage, you can choose to load save or start a new save in the main menu. Currently the menu buttons are empty but functional, haven't design them yet</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Localstorage is a completely new thing in SC, spent a bunch of time coding the saving and loading part, but again, it's just one sentence in the changelog"</p>
    <p class="ps block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Apparently, localstorage can only save strings, so I cannot directly save classes and have to save them one var by one var, and number variables have to be converted back. Those arrays are also separately stored. Probably done this very inefficiently.</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You could have just stored the achi and upgrade arrays in one string instead of 1000 separate ones! 2k localstorages, what the hell!"</p>
    <p class="ps block multiline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Currently the only way to save is through console or by clicking s, probably gonna add autosave later. Preferably, it should save every update(), to prevent cheating
         - Currently the game still ticks in the main menu before loading or starting a new save, and you can save in that case as well, which will cover the original save with a new one. Gonna deal with that later.</p>
    <p class="ps block">- Finally added the main shop food</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">"Isn't that the entire point of this game? Why is that added after 10 days of development?"</p>
    <p class="ps block multiline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Moved some styles to classes, added a border rounded corners, and remade the percentage bar to match with the xp bar. Also added some quotes to the description. Other stuff are just copied from SC3
         - And I added a border to the .ps class to make those food descriptions less compact. This affected the changelog as well, the garbage written here is more sparcely placed, but it is still garbage no one will read.
     - And they actually work. In other words, the game now works.
     - However, there is a very big issue with the balancing of the game which existed since SC1. As the food increases the KG every second and not the currency like other games, which then the KG the money output per click, the money you can get per second increases when idle without buying more food. In most idle games, you progress by using the currency to increase the currency per second, however in this game, running it already increase the currency per click. So basically, you can just buy some food and then come back after a while, then click, and you will gain so much money you can immediately buy much hier tier stuff, then you wait again. I might have to make it so that the KGPS slowly decreases when not buying food, similar to antimatter dimensions.</p>
     <p class="ps changelog-quote block">"Ugh, a long paragraph of shit no one will ever read" - literally describing the changelog</p>
     <p class="ps block">- All updates (KG/KGPS/MPC updates and calculations, food count/cost/KGPS updates and calculations, percentage and xp bar updates etc) are generalized into one function, and is called every tick and every change. Optimization and performance is not my job, and there (probably) isn't any problems</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block multiline">"However, there seems to be some issue when loading this changelog as it gets longer... expecially when i included images here. Currently at 421ms max, how high can it go?"
"I guess, preloading images next?" - Me asking myself, while not knowing how preloading works</p>

    <h1 class="block">Week 1</h1>
    <p class="block">17/1/2022 - 23/1/2022</p>
    <h2 class="h2s changelog-others block">Something no one will read</h2>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">"Something I myself also doesn't want to read"</p>
    <p class="ps block multiline">- Completely abandoned Snorlax Clicker 3 (which i haven't touched for a few months) and decided to start the 4th version of Snorlax Clicker, because of how messy the code is. With a random name I came up with after playing the Avaritia mod
     - Instead of using a billion variables and separate functions for each food, I realized that classes exist
     - And instead of stuffing all the html and js in one file (and tell others that i coded a few k lines of code), I realized out that separate .js, .css, and .html files exist
     - And instead of a bunch of styles in the html code, I realized that you can have multiple css classes
     - And instead of reseting every time you reload, I realized out that local save exist. Saving and loading is probably the main thing I'll work on
     - And instead of a bunch of divs in a bunch of divs containing more divs, I realized that tables exist
     - (Hopefully) Better UI, and a logo & menu screen to make it look more like a game
        - Apparently, making stuff less bold and words less compact & smaller seems to make the game look much better. Top bars also significantly smaller.
        - Rounded corners go brrr
     - Why the hell is Portal 40 times more efficient than Asteroid? Purely for the 177013?
     - Decided to include an XP feature, so the top bar have more stuff and is less useless. XP probably would be gained through achievements instead of the SC2 way which give XP every upgrade.
     - Also a "catalyst" as a second currency to fill up more slots in the top bar.</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the reason to randomly add 2 new features is purely to fill up the top bar?" - Me to myself, cause no one plays this game</p>
    <p class="ps block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Time to actually draw the 50 missing assets in SC3, i guess</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"F**k anti-alising I just want to draw pixel art!" - Me, an idiot who uses pixlr to draw pixel art</p>
    <p class="ps changelog-quote block">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also, why is the 'mirror' feature in pixlr not symmetrical?" - Me, an idiot who still uses pixlr to draw pixel art</p>
    <h2 class="h2s changelog-others block">Progress</h2>
    <p class="ps block multiline">- <s>Wasted</s> Spent a bunch of time in the changelog. Wrote a lot of useless stuff here (and a bunch of changelog related css), when the main.html only have a top bar.
- Mainly focused on js functions and classes & css, <s>aka no useful content</s> to make future coding clearer and easier.
<p class="ps changelog-quote block multiline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Literally 80% of the time doing this... but placed in one line in changelog"
     "this. this. this. this. this."</p>
<p class="ps block multiline">- Assets +4: XP, Catalyst, Logout Icon, Game Icon. Still haven't worked on any missing assets from SC3.
     - Game logo:</p>
<img src="../assets/images/main/logo.png" style="width:400px">
<p class="ps changelog-quote block">"For some reason I made this icon 4k... so now I mush set a width for the icon, otherwise the letter "A" eats up the entire 1920x1080 screen"</p>
<p class="ps block multiline">- Currently added the topmost bar, top bar, and snorlax display. Copied from SC3 and rewrote most of the code.
     - Differences compared to SC3
         - Topmost bar thinner and words less bold. The timer and player count now aligned to the right. Added a logout button and icon (best pixel art i've drawn so far?)
         - Also included a real time "last saved" in the topmost bar, this and the timer is the only thing that currently works.
         - Top bar have a circular corner, much thinner, and added a second currency catalyst and a new XP feature. Currently using level^2 x 100 as the formula for the main XP. (Made an XP class, so more types of XP later?)
         - Probably gonna add a tier system to fill in the empty space next to the level, and you have to complete tasks similar to the Genshin Adventure Book to advance in tiers
         - Snorlax display doesn't have any visible changes (Actually, there is a 3px difference), only moved styles from html to .css
         - Completely rewrote the num to word function, now it's fixed at 3 d.p. when there is a suffix, and 1 d.p. when there isn't, and 1 sig. fig when smaller than 1.
         - Also an option for integral varibales to not show the d.p. Another option to show words "Nonillion" "Quattordecillion" instead of suffixes "No" "QaD". Currently up to 1 trigintillion.
