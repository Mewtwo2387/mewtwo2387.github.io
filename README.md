# Ei's Github Page I guess

Oh hello in here :yanfeismug:

I literally pushed my entire project folder in github so there's all these half-complete weird stuff that doesn't work

This is basically all my code except for the basement stuff like incursion which is in the [Basement's Collective Repo](https://github.com/Mewtwo2387/basement) and the closed-source stuff from my work which you have to pay to use.


# Projects

## [Imperial CS Y1 Tracker](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Tracker/)
The only useful thing in this list.

## [Avaritilax 4](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Avaritilax/)
A remade version of [Idle Snorlax 3](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/SC3/) with slightly better everything.

This is probably the only thing that is playable here.

Now with mining and crafting in Alpha 1.1.2.

## [Project Keqei](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Project%20Keqei/)
An online multiplayer turn-based rpg 6v6 gacha game, featuring members from TheGenshinPlace (and OC made by the members) as the characters. The storyline focuses on Ei breaking the fourth wall and excaping the world, while Keq and the egirls trying to fix the glitches and diasters caused by Ei.

*(None of these are actually made, the game is discontinued before it even started and will be replaced with Transient Assault / Incursion in the future. And, the server is offline anyways.)*

## [QueQat](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/QueQat)
An AI made with Deep Q-Learning, used to reduce queueing time in multi-queue systems where different people have different service times, such as supermarkets. QueQat can assign customers to queues based on their service time, and can reduce the total waiting time by approximately 20%.

*(Wow, a project that is actually complete here! Unfortunately, the flask app isn't up either so there's nothing to try. Unless you time travel back to August 2022 in Hong Kong Central Library to find me in an exhibition.)*

## [Re:Ei](https://github.com/Mewtwo2387/mewtwo2387.github.io/tree/main/Ei2)
The newer Ei bot for The Basement, with stuff like TGP hangman, member lore, image generation, levels, and stuff shamelessly copied from other bots.

## [Idle Snorlax 3](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/SC3/)
An old version of [Avaritilax 4](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Avaritilax/) with slightly worse everything.

Anyways, did I even talked about what this Snorlax game is here?


## [Ei Bot](https://github.com/Mewtwo2387/mewtwo2387.github.io/tree/main/Ei)
The original Ei bot to simp for Keq. Uh.

## [Keqboard](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Keqboard/)
A completely useless program that "translates" stuff into weirder stuff (,,,,,,ffffffuwut9s[ wedwieuwu[ otni[ ffffffuwut9s[ "9setw9snwt"[ tht[ mwgowp[ 9s9sewe9suwu[ eiwetewpmoc[ ,,,!!!eifmoo iah)

## [Astro](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Astro/)
Supposed to be a starmap generator to generate fake star maps and constellations. Ended up being a thing for me to test responsive CSS and doesn't have any functionality other than generation some dots on a circle.

## [Binary Collatz Sequence](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Collatz/)
The Collatz Sequence forms some cool pattern in binary for big numbers

## [OC Wiki](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/OC/)
Supposed to be an alternative OC Wiki for TGP, without the fandom restrictions so you can have some wild CSS like glitched text. Now with nothing but missingEi.

## [GachaPlace](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/GachaPlace/aaa.html)
A demo for a concept of a gacha r/place where you have to pull for pixels to place them. It is just an offline canvas here.

## [IdlePixel Auto](https://github.com/Mewtwo2387/mewtwo2387.github.io/blob/main/IdlePixel%20Auto/idp.js)
A script for [Idle Pixel](https://idle-pixel.com) to automatically grind magic XP, with a normal distribution to avoid detection. The original script also includes auto smelting and farming, and auto-blocks stupid misclicks like selling gems to the NPC and converting stone to XP. But I forgot where I put that script and I only found this old version.

## [Snorlax Clicker 2](https://github.com/Mewtwo2387/mewtwo2387.github.io/blob/main/SC2.apk)
An even older version of [Avaritilax 4](https://mewtwo2387.github.io/Avaritilax/) done on App Inventor 2 during primary school computer lessons.
